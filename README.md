# Barbados-Traffic-Analysis-Challenge
Barbados Traffic Analysis Challenge

Can you identify the root causes of traffic in a Barbados roundabout?
On the small island state of Barbados, cars, buses and taxis are the primary mode of transport. As a result, traffic is a well-known problem that affects every Barbadian citizen. The Ministry of Transport and Works wants your help to try and solve the problem with machine learning.

In this challenge, your task is to use AI to recognise the root causes of traffic in a specific roundabout in Barbados. You will be provided with labelled video data, and your model should be able to identify the root causes of increased time spent in the roundabout.

The winning models will help the Ministry of Transport and Works identify and address root causes of traffic in roundabouts. They will use this information to design interventions to reduce traffic across the island, improving the lives of every citizen.
